## comments
- tie back to what they're actually doing behaviorally
- simple stats representation: e.g. general linear model, logistic regression, etc.
- correlation matrix
- missing components: env factors / ecological params (elevation, DTR, temp, altitude, latitude, climatic var.)
- Triad: pick out and examine activity patterns from indivs with successful breeding under long-day 
- diurnal, nocturnal, periodicity
- pair activities as predictor variable?



#### Questions
- what aspects of circ rhythms are captured in these patterns (gen, sex, pop)
- 3 groups + chi-square test?

- loading in PCA?

- logistic regression: breeding (long-day) vs. activity patterns
- multiple logistic regression of these params?
- parse out which of these params: predictive of breeding or not 


##### site diff:
- + sex, gen, latitude, photo

##### activities: 
- daytime vs. nighttime
- 1st 3 hours into the night / last 3 hours of the night (before light-on)
- slopes of curves for each breeding activity & success
- sex diff in activity patterns (e.g. are males onlt active at night?)
- try parsing out diff components of activity groups 1-3


###### plotting
1. [ShinyR-DAM](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0031-9)
- clustering, controlling w/o pair
